  <h1>Happy Monthsary!</h1>
  <p>Dear Allyana Joyce</p>
  <p>Today marks 8 months since we started this amazing journey together. I am incredibly grateful for every moment we've shared, and I look forward to many more months of love, laughter, and adventure with you by my side.</p>
  <p>You are the <span class="heart">&hearts;</span> of my life, and I am so lucky to have you. Thank you for everything you do, and for making my life brighter with your presence. Here's to many more beautiful months together!</p>
